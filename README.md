# evomod

## Description
Code originally developed for the Linguistic Institute courses [*Computational Modeling of Sound Change*](http://lsa2013.lsa.umich.edu/2012/05/computational-modeling-of-sound-change/) (2013) and [*Computational Approaches to Sound Change*](https://lsa2015.uchicago.edu/courses/computational-approaches-sound-change) (2015). Contains R implementations of 

- Janet Pierrehumbert's exemplar model of the evolution of phonetic categories, as detailed in her 2001 paper [*Exemplar dynamics: Word frequency, lenition, and contrast*](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jbp/publications/exemplar_dynamics.pdf) 
- The model of the evolution of a phonetic trait in a population setting developed by Kirby and Sonderegger (2015) [*Bias and population structure in the actuation of sound change*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04420).

For these courses we also developed an implementation of the evolution of vowel systems based on Bart de Boer's 2000 paper [*Self organization in vowel systems*](http://ai.vub.ac.be/%7Ebart/papers/deBoerJOP2000.pdf), which can be found [here](https://github.com/mlml/deboerVowels).

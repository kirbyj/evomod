# Implementation of Kirby and Sonderegger (2015)

## Description
R code to simlulate evolution of a phonetic trait in a population setting, as used in Kirby and Sonderegger (2015) [*Bias and population structure in the actuation of sound change*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04420).

The directory contains the following files:

- ```ksIntro.Rmd```: R Markdown walkthrough of the implementation
- ```ksSims.R```: simulation code
- ```ksPlots.R```: code for visualization of results
- ```ksExtensions.Rmd```: R Markdown document suggesting possible extensions to the model
